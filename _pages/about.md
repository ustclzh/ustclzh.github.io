<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE), Georgia Institute of technology. 
Before joining Georgia Tech, I was a research assistant at the City university of Hong Kong. 
I received my B.S degree in Mathematics from Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2014, graduated with honors, and my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and (Jointly) City University of Hong Kong.

My research areas are computer experiments and uncertainty quantification.
My research interests involve integrating domain knowledge (e.g., conservation law, mechanical models, bio-system models) into statistical modeling and parameter inference. 
In particular, I'm working on building new statistical models and machine learning algorithms for parameter inference problems, providing a novel way for scientists to calibrate their scientific model from data, and for statisticians to integrate scientific knowledge for parameter inference and uncertainty quantification of a complex computer model.

My current research focuses Bayesian calibration of computer models involving complex partial differential equations (PDE) and stochastic differential equations(SDE). 
I am proposing new models that can incorporate information from physics, i.e. PDE or SDE constraints, without further computational burden.
Thus, the new physics-informed methods can handle sparse observation cases and are more stable to data noise. 

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).-->
